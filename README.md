# Air Cargo Delay Analyzer (Beginner Python Project)

This is a small beginner-friendly Python project that analyzes **air cargo shipment delays**.

It uses a simple CSV dataset of shipments from KPDX to various destinations and calculates:

- Total number of shipments  
- Minimum, maximum, and average delay  
- Number of delayed vs on-time/early shipments  
- Average delay per airline (AF, KL, DL)  
- A basic performance summary  

The project demonstrates beginner Python skills:

- Loading data from a CSV file  
- Lists and dictionaries  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- If/else decision logic  
- Indexing and slicing
